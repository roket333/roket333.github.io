I will say that there is one currently in development, and it is, as of now, planned to be an open-world game much like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I don't want to spoil too much more, mainly because as of now I have no actual work done. It is currently in the idea phase, but I fully intend to actually work on it!",
