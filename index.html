          <p class="bigtext">What is this?</p>
          <hr style="border: 3px solid #e5e5e5;">
          this is a fursuit that i have created myself.<br>my best description is<br>"VR headset in a fursuit head with animatronic parts"
        </div>
        <div class="aboutcontainer">
          <p class="bigtext">How does it work?</p>
          <hr style="border: 3px solid #e5e5e5;">
          hidden in the fursuit head are two cameras i placed to give me vision accurate to how the real character would see.<br>
          the image from those cameras gets displayed to two high resolution and high framereate displays in the head that i see.<br>
          some info such as heartrate, blood oxygen levels, inside humidity and temp, and other stuff gets overlaid so i know what is going on
        </div>
        <div class="aboutcontainer">
          <p class="bigtext">How long did it take to make?</p>
          <hr style="border: 3px solid #e5e5e5;">
          as of now, the fursuit is incomplete. as you see it now, its more of a plastic head with exposed electronics and tail.<br>
          i've been dreaming about it since August 2024 or so, and actually started working on it in late November 2024
        </div>
        <div class="aboutcontainer">
          <p class="bigtext">How do you breathe in there?</p>
          <hr style="border: 3px solid #e5e5e5;">
          i just breathe normally, like any fursuiter does
        </div>
        <div class="aboutcontainer">
          <p class="bigtext">Wont all the CO2 inside make it hard to breathe?</p>
          <hr style="border: 3px solid #e5e5e5;">
          inside the head, i have a VOC and eCO2 sensor. this will detect and record the VOCs from 0 to 60,000 parts per billion, and estimate the CO2 from 400 to 60,000 parts per million.<br>
          the reason why i went with the CO2 estimator instead of a dedicated module for it is it just made more sense given the use case. less expensive, smaller, larger reading range.<br>
          when CO2 levels get dangerously high inside the head, it will warn me, and at a certain point, urge me to take off the head immediately<br>
          it will also let me know if the air coming in the nose is high CO2 as well
        </div>
        <div class="aboutcontainer">
          <p class="bigtext">Dont you overheat in that?</p>
          <hr style="border: 3px solid #e5e5e5;">
          dont get me wrong, it gets very warm in here. however, i have a ventilation system consisting of two fans that take in air through the fursuit's nose.<br>
          that air then passes over some sensors to get information about it, then goes through one of the fans.<br>
          one fan uses the air to cool the computers inside, and the other pushes the air through vents to help keep me cool.<br>
          having the head base not be 100% solid and have holes in it also helps
        </div>
        <div class="aboutcontainer">
          <p class="bigtext">How do you hear?</p>
          <hr style="border: 3px solid #e5e5e5;">
          my hearing in this is impaired for sure, but the ears are functional. sound can travel down the ears and into my actual ears.<br>
          think those horns old people use in cartoons to hear better
        </div>
        <div class="aboutcontainer">
          <p class="bigtext">What parts did you make yourself?</p>
          <hr style="border: 3px solid #e5e5e5;">
          i designed and 3d printed nearly all the parts. the only things i really didnt make are the computers, screens, sensors, and motors

          <p class="bigtext">What software are you using?</p>
          <hr style="border: 3px solid #e5e5e5;">
          for both the internal and external displays, i am using Unity. i needed to use some game engine because i dont know how to write a program from scratch.<br>
          plus, the BrainBit used for ears, eyes, and tail movement has an API for Unity, so it makes moving the eyes easier

        <div class="maintext">Open Cool Treats<br>Fans for fursuiters in the shape of various treats and foods</div>

        <div class="aboutcontainer">
          <p class="bigtext">What is this?</p>
          <hr style="border: 3px solid #e5e5e5;">
          Open Cool Treats is an idea for a line of fans designed primarily for fursuiters, though anyone can use them. They are shaped after various treats and foods, so that fursuiters can cool off with a photogenic prop<br>The actual product itself is completely open source and free to download the code and models for, for those that feel comfortable doing programming and soldering<br>Or, for those who prefer a ready-to-go product, custom pre-assembled ones will be for sale. They come in two levels, "Plus" and "Premium"<br>It is currently still in the prototype phase, with an unknown time of completion, but I think it will be a nice product for fursuiters
        </div>
        <div class="aboutcontainer">
          <p class="bigtext">What is the difference between the Plus and Premium versions?</p>
          <hr style="border: 3px solid #e5e5e5;">
          Firstly, I just want to clarify that the differences between the two versions are purely internal. There will be no external designs exclusive to one version or the other. I do not belive this is fair to anyone.<br>Plus is for those who just want a simple fan prop, without any fancy extras. It will be the more affordable version and be powered by a 9V battery and a switch to turn it on and off.<br>Premium has additional nice to have features, as well as a longer battery life. Premium will be offered with a 2,200 mAh, 4,400 mAh, 6,600 mAh, and 10,000 mAh capacity lithium ion battery<br>Both versions will achieve the same goal of cooling off a fursuiter with a fan, so if you just want that, Plus is what you want. If you want longer battery life, variable fan speed, and rotational activation of the fan, Premium is what you want
        </div>
        <div class="aboutcontainer">
          <p class="bigtext">How much are the different versions?</p>
          <hr style="border: 3px solid #e5e5e5;">
          If you 3D print and build it yourself, the cost is just materials. The models and instructions will be free forever.<br>Pricing for pre-assembled ones depends on the version, battery capacity, and if you requested a custom design.<br>My current goal is to have the Plus version go for $40 USD or less, and have the Premium version go for $130 USD or less, neither option accounting for custom designs.
        </div>
        <div class="aboutcontainer">
          <p class="bigtext">Can I upgrade my Plus to a Premium or downgrade my Premium to a Plus?</p>
          <hr style="border: 3px solid #e5e5e5;">
          At this point in time, my goal is to have both versions use the same models aside from the plate where the buttons are. Time will tell if this is realistically possible, but hopefully the final answer is yes
        </div>
        <div class="aboutcontainer">
          <p class="bigtext">Can I assemble and sell Open Cool Treats using your models?</p>
          <hr style="border: 3px solid #e5e5e5;">
          I would prefer if you didn't do that, because then that means you are using my work for your own profit. I worked hard to make my own designs.<br>Please also do not steal and sell someone else's models without their permission.
        </div>

          You absolutely can! Please just credit me for the instructions, bill of materials, and code. You can even sell Open Cool Treats that use your own models if you want, and dont have to pay me a cent for royalties or anything like that. Just please do not try to say that they're endorsed by me or that I had any involvement in your design.

          I am very sorry if it seems that I have stolen yours or someone else's idea for this. I did some breif searches and did find similar products on the market, but I promise that I came up with the idea on my own, and developed all parts of Open Cool Treats on my own as well, unless stated otherwise. If you still feel that I have stolen something, and you are the creator of that something, please get in contact with me at one of my social media links below.<br>I do wish to talk about it and dispel any possible misunderstandings. I dont want bad blood.

          Because fursuiters no doubt want to stay cool, but shoving a rectangle into their suit's mouth might break the magic for some. I can't really remember the last time I saw a non-infant sapient creature shoving an inedible object into its mouth.<br>Disguising it as treats or food makes it much less likely to break the magic, while still allowing fursuiters to not overheat. It also gives the fursuiter a prop to do whatever they want with.
